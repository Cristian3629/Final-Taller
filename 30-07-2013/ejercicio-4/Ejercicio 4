Describa y ejemplifique el uso de la siguiente instrucción de precompilación: #ifndef.

#ifndef <token>
    /* code */
#else
    /* code to include if the token is defined */
#endif

#ifndef checks whether the given token has been #defined earlier in the file or in an included file; if not, it includes the code between it and the closing #else or, if no #else is present, #endif statement. #ifndef is often used to make header files idempotent by defining a token once the file has been included and checking that the token was not set at the top of that file.

#ifndef _INCL_GUARD
#define _INCL_GUARD
#endif
